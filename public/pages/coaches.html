Coach Danny previously taught biology, chemistry, physics, and environmental science. He has been running for over 19 years with a lifelong love of the outdoors, mostly seeking rocky trails, alpine lakes, and mountain summits in our beautiful region. Personal running highlights include the 93-mile Wonderland Trail around təqʷuʔmaʔ (Tahoma/Mt. Rainier), Alaska’s Mount Marathon race, and countless adventures in nature. He’s a huge Star Wars nerd, a frequent D&D player, and a passionate social justice advocate, especially for women’s and trans athletes’ equity in sports, for Indigenous rights, and against diet culture. He lives with his partner, Liz (also a trail ultrarunner), and their rescue husky, Juneau, on dxʷdəwʔabš (Duwamish) and sdukʷalbixʷ (Snoqualmie) lands, in what’s today known as Issaquah.</p></div>

        <div class="coach-image"><img src="../images/Coach Profile Pictures/CoachKruegerProfilePic.jpg" alt="Picture of"/> </div>
        <div class="coach-bio"> <p>My name is Elise Krueger (she/her), and I will be an Assistant Coach for Newport this year! I have been coaching Cross-Country and Track for the last ten years. Most recently I was an assistant coach at Lake Washington High School. Something I am very proud of is the culture change I saw in the teams I worked with over eight seasons coaching with the kangs. I look forward to bringing positivity, fun, and a competitive nature to Newport Cross-Country! My love for running began at Zeiger Elementary where I was encouraged by an awesome PE teacher who I am still in contact with today! I also ran for Rogers High School in their Cross-Country and Track programs from 2006-2009. I believe that I have been running and loving it for about 20 years now. I am more of a casual runner these days, racing the sunflower relay every year in Winthrop and running when injury allows with the team. This will be my tenth year of teaching Health and PE. I was hired as an Adapted PE teacher for the Bellevue School District, and I look forward to serving students of all ability levels! In my spare time I enjoy playing board games, softball, pickleball and traveling with my partner and dog, Pancake! Can’t wait to see what the season has in store! Go Knights!</p></div>

        <div class="coach-image"><img src="../images/Coach Profile Pictures/CoachKelseyStrengthCoachProfilePic.jpg" alt="Picture of"/> </div>
        <div class="coach-bio"> <p>Kelsey Shimada (she/her) is a strength and conditioning coach at Newport High School, returning to her alma mater as a coach after nearly 16 years. She competed in golf, gymnastics, diving, and track and field as a Newport Knight, and then continued on to pole vault at the University of Washington (as a walk-on). Her experiences in the UW weight room and later on in the CrossFit gym, sparked an interest in weightlifting. She wants to destigmatize weights for teenagers, especially for women and for non-football athletes, and she believes that weights can not only improve strength, but also prevent injury and teach proper body coordination and mechanics. She is excited to spectate her first ever XC meet and has loved getting to work with the team this past summer.

        <div class="coach-image"><img src="../images/Coach Profile Pictures/TrainerAlexATC.jpg" alt="Picture of"/> </div>
        <div class="coach-bio"> <p>My name is Alex Tinajero (he/him) and I am the Athletic Trainer for Newport High School. I’ve been in sports medicine for the last 10 years. Prior to college, I was an Army combat paratrooper for 8 years serving from 2005-2013. I am an avid fisherman, sprinter, and weightlifter. My passion lies in pushing the boundaries of my physical and mental training to prepare for whatever life throws my way. With regards to sports medicine, I tend to have a holistic approach. Unfortunately, tape does not fix everything and there are many modalities I use to help facilitate the recovery process. If I’m not covering practices or games, my door is always open for questions!
